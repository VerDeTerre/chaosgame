# Chaos Game

This demonstration was inspired by the [Chaos Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) video by [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A). General information is available from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game).

The basic idea is that starting with a polygon, a fractal pattern will emerge within by repeatedly moving a fixed proportion (in this case, halfway) towards a randomly selected vertex and marking the resulting point.

To view, clone the repo and open index.html in your browser (or just visit <https://jtbnntt.github.io/chaosgame/>). Controls are provided to select the number of vertexes (which will restart the generation), loops per update (which affects rendering speed), play, pause and restart.

Here's how a triangle can end up looking:
